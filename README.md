# ðŸ’¸ NoSpend - Power up your wallet

**NoSpend is an open source project to easily manage your expenses**

**You can host it yourself or access the official website: https://dresch.dev**

It was designed to work better when in a mobile device, but you can use it in the desktop as well.

Also, it can be downloaded from the browser, as it is a PWA (Progressive Web App)
